Objects are just mappings of str to void pointer

CURRENTLY: strings that are used on objects are not mapped at all, and if there's a name collision, there's nothing that can be done

LATER: make a way to map certain strings to certain other strings for specific libraries to avoid name collisions

EXAMPLE OF IT GOING WRONG:
* Lib1 wants lib3
* Lib2 wants lib3
...but they mean a different library

{{{
HOW MAPPING MAY WORK:
import lib1 -- import w/o mapping
import lib1 mapping {lib3 -> lib3_author} -- import w/ mapping

WHY THIS WILL WORK:
Each dependency's author will distinguish the dependency's dependencies themselves, which will lead to all subdependencies having unique names within the dependency. Thus it will be possible to remap these unique names to other names within the current program, which will make it possible to resolve any conflicts between any dependencies
